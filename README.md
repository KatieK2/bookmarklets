# Bookmarlets

Some bookmarklets that I use for front end web development. Unless otherwise noted, I wrote these.

* *Breakpoint Backgrounds*: Adds body background colors for tablet (teal), mobile (magenta) and widescreen (orange) browser widths.
* *View Source*: Changes URL to view source code delivered to client.
* *Viewport Resizer*: Adds a toolbar to top of viewport which demonstrates content in common mobile viewports and reports current viewport size. By [Malte Wassermann](http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/)

## Usage 

Create a new bookmark in your browser and give it a name. Paste any bookmarlet's source code into the location field. Load the URL that you want to use the bookmarlet on, and then click the bookmarklet to run it.
